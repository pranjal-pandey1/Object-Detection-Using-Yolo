#### Traditional attendance system which consumes 10 to 15 minutes of time in 50 minutes of lecture hour. It also aims at eliminating human errors and proxy in recording the attendance of the student.
Implementation, and evaluation of a face recognition-based attendance system utilizing the YOLO algorithm.
The integration of face recognition into attendance management systems entails capturing images of individuals upon their entry into a designated area, such as a classroom, workplace, or event venue. 
These images are then processed in real-time, with facial recognition algorithms matching the captured faces against a database of pre-registered embeddings. Through this seamless integration of image 
capture, processing, and comparison, attendance records can be generated accurately and efficiently, without the need for manual intervention.
